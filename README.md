# NYCDA jQuery Todo App

I've provided you all with a half finished todo list project. You're going to
finish it. You'll find an HTML file with all of the starting elements and
necessary files linked up, a CSS file that's styled them, and a JS file with
comments that describe what it should do. Without editing the CSS and HTML, I
want you to make all of the comments in the JS file actually work. There are
some bonus challenges in there, if you want to go above and beyond, but
definitely not a requirement.
